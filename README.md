I love to play TFT, and like many players, I want to check items and comps that are suitable for one champion.

This tool helps to generate an image that contains items built and comps for the champion from [lolchess.gg](https://lolchess.gg)

You don't need to enter the champion name correctly, this tool will try to fuzzy guess the champion name.

#### Show me!

```bash
./run.sh nasus
```
